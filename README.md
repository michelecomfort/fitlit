# FitLit 

Turing School of Software & Design

2108 FEE, Mod 2 - Group Project, Part One

## Abstract
Fitlit is a web app that presents user's with a number of helpful health metrics- daily step count, daily water consumption, daily sleep hours and quality -on a single dashboard with widgets. Line graphs display hydration and sleep each day for the last week.

## Languages/Technology
Javascript, HTML, CSS, Webpack, Chart.js, Github

## Learning Goals
* Begin working with network requests and Fetch API
* Process and manipulate large data sets with iterator methods
* Design and build out a user-friendly dashboard from scratch
* Use ES6 classes to write modular, reusable code
* Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Refactor code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
* Ensure application follows best practices for accessibility and WAI-ARIA compliance
* Leverage Sass to DRY up CSS
* Practice talking about code and high level technical concepts
* Implement feedback to improve product and process

## Install & Setup
1. Clone down the local API server and follow install instructions [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/fitlit-api) 
2. Open a new terminal window and run the local server that holds the api `npm start` both servers need to be running
3. Clone down this repo
4. `cd` into the directory
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `npm start` to open the local server
7. Head to `localhost:8080` in your browser

## Web App Attributes
1. On load, users see their dashboard. Featured prominently is their profile information.
2. Users see how many oz of water they consumed today as well as a line graph of consumption over the whole week.
3. In addition to seeing steps for the day, they can see both their own and the Fitlit community's daily step goals.
4. User can see both the day's sleep hours and quality as well as their all-time average. A line graph at the bottom displays hours and quality over the past week.
5. A sidenav bar on the left has a collection of buttons that allows users to navigate to different activities easily.
6. A widget allowing users to input activity data to be submited to the local server.
7. Screen layout changes with screen size.

## Future Improvements
1. Build out profile photo generation and display. 
2. Allow graphs to be uncapped and display a dynamic range based on user.
3. A card flip animation once user submits custom data.
4. Update the web page with the new data the user inputs.
