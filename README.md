# FitLit 

Turing School of Software & Design

2108 FEE, Mod 2 - Group Project, Part One

## Abstract
Fitlit is a web app that presents user's with a number of helpful health metrics- daily step count, daily water consumption, daily sleep hours and quality -on a single dashboard with widgets. Line graphs display hydration and sleep each day for the last week.

## Languages/Technology
Javascript, HTML, CSS, Webpack, Chart.js, Github

## Learning Goals
* Begin working with network requests and Fetch API
* Process and manipulate large data sets with iterator methods
* Design and build out a user-friendly dashboard from scratch
* Use ES6 classes to write modular, reusable code

## Install & Setup
1. Clone down this repo
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` to open the local server
5. Head to `localhost:8080` in your browser

## Web App Attributes
1. On load, users see their dashboard. Featured prominently is their profile photo & profile information.
2. To the right is the hydration widget. Users see how many oz consumed today as well as a line graph of consumption over the whole week.
3. Bottom left is step data. In addition to seeing steps for the day, they can see both their own and the Fitlit community's daily step goals.
4. In the middle, user can see both the day's sleep hours and quality as well as their all-time average. A line graph at the bottom displays hours and quality over the past week.
5. On the right-side, users can see their list of friends.
6. A sidenav bar on the left has a collection of buttons. They will be implemented in part two.

## Future Improvements
1. Add functionality to the sidenav buttons. Take user's to different pages with more detailed data.
2. Build out profile photo generation and display.
